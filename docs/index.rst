hipct-reg
=========

Code for registering high-resolution HiP-CT region of interest datasets to low-resolution HiP-CT full-organ datasets.

This package contains the image registration code.
It is designed to be used internally by the HiP-CT team, but publicly released so our registrations are reproducible and in case anyone else finds the code helpful.
